<h1>Ballot stuffing</h1>
<i>Ballot stuffing is to put more than one ballot in the ballot box OR people monitoring or handling ballots/ballot boxes
adds ballots.. Since the Norwegian elections in 2019 had two election in one, the only control number is the number of
total people that voted. Most people vote in the local election (municipality) and not the regional election (county).
By blindly adding extra ballots in the regional election, you would have a good chance of adding extra votes without 
being noticed.</i><br><br>

<i>This overview will show you data on the issue to check if this might happen to the Norwegian elections.</i><br><br>
